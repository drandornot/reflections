Reflections from lesson 2.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init produces an empty repository.  It adds a hidden subdirectory 
called .git to the working directory.  If you don't do this, there will
be no place for your commits to be recorded.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a list of files that become part of the commit.  
The staging area allows files to be associated with each other so they are
all updated simultaneously during a git commit.  The staging area provides
a means for multiple files to be updated together.
