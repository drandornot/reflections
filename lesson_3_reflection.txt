When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is useful if I am using different machines to develop code
or if I am working with a team.  The downside is that I must be connected to 
the internet to use the remote repository.  The upside is that I can work with
off-site collaborators and I don't need to worry about the machine holding my
repository crashing.  One possible concern is security.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If others are making changes to the code remotely, changes can happen
at any time.  Automatic pulls will could result in changes occurring
while a file is being edited and mandate a merge when it was time to
save the local file.
